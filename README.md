# Fall-2020-CS-1714-Project-1-Dice-Game
This code was made for the first project for CS 1714: Intro to Comp Sci II, where we first learned C code. The task was to make a single
.h file and two .c files and use those as well as extensive use of enumerators and randomized variables to make a program that simulates a 
two-player dice game, where two computer-generated players (or NPCs) roll dice and earn/lose points depending on the gametype they're playing in 
(ex: if the dice round is a DOUBLE type, then the players have a chance of winning double the points the dice rolled or losing twice as many).
